Paul Hammant and friends maintaining a list of **Dependency Injection containers and frameworks**, 
delving in the history a little and categorizing the alternate sub-types. 
Paul was active in the community some years before "Dependency Injection" was coined/popularized by Martin Fowler in [Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection pattern](https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) 
He had previously attempted an ill-advised numerical categorization with 
[Inversion of Control Rocks](https://paulhammant.com/files/JDJ_2003_12_IoC_Rocks.pdf) in Java Developer Report (2003).
